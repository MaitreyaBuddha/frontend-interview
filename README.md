# Quizlet Frontend Interview Question

## What's this for?
For your upcoming interview, we'll ask you to build a single-page web app that won't have to deal with API calls or routing. We believe in setting up candidates for success, so we want to help you get set up with the tools you're most comfortable with.

You're welcome to use any framework, language, and build process you're most familiar with, but we highly recommend using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue. You can also use jQuery or [vanilla Javascript](http://vanilla-js.com/). You're also encouraged to use other libraries you prefer e.g., Redux, Immutable.js, MobX, Flow, Typescript, etc.

Your options:
1. Start with one of the two provided subfolders,  `react-js` and `vanilla-js`. These are starting examples that you can use and build on top off.
2. Use a boiletplate like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed), or [vue-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).
3. Set up your own enviornment (Elm, Reason, Clojurescript... whatever you desire!)

**Bottom line**: We want you to be successful so please pick the option that you feel most at-ease with.

Questions? We're happy to help. Just email your recruiter and we'll get back to you.
